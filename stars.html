        <h2>Stars</h2>
        <p>
          A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of
          plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is
          the Sun. There are billions and billions of stars in the universe that
          we can see from the naked eye on Earth.
        </p>

        <h4>Star Formation</h4>
        <p>
          Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most
          galaxies called nebulas. They are like star nurseries. The dust and
          gas in the nebula will start to collapse under its own gravity. As it
          collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. A dense, hot
          core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. This forms the outer
          layers of the star.
        </p>

        <h4>A Star's Fate</h4>
        <p>
          At the stars core, fusion takes place to combine small elements to
          create heavier ones. This fusion happens until the elements being
          combined form iron. As soon as all these elements become iron, the
          star starts to expand its outer layers and the star becomes a red
          giant. Then the star starts to shed its outermost layer, exposing the
          inner layers. This shedding happens until it reaches the stars core.
          The core then collapses under its own gravity and explodes. The star
          will now become a white dwarf, a nebula, a neutron star, or a black
          hole.
